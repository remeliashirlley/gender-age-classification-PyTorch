## Gender Age Classification with Deep Learning

This project focuses on gender and age classification using deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch. The Adience dataset is employed, and the Deeplake library is utilized for efficient data handling. Transfer learning is employed with pretrained models such as ResNet, MobileNet, and Visual Transformers. Additionally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture proposed by Levi Hassner is implemented for accurate classification.
